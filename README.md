Training a model through Behavioral Cloning!

Training network was based on Dave-2 "https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/"    - (paper: https://gvelarde.com/Press/Teaching/G2_Bruckner_Hervas_Martinez_Ugarte_Driving.pdf)

Training sim was used from: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
